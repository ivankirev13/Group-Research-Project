# Group-Research-Project

This is the group research project for year 2 of my degree at Imperial College London. The topic is a county level exploration of COVID-19-associated orphanhood during 2020 in the United States and is described in detail in the pdf file. The .tex file is also included (written in overleaf), however, the R scripts that were used to implement the techniques described in the pdf are not available.
